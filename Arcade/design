hangman:
To implement hangman I will start with a list of words that the program can pull from.
The words will be hard coded in and it will randomly pick one.
then I will make a second word that is all *'s with the same length of the first word.
this will be the word that gets displayed.
then i will take in a guess (only take in single character alpha)
then I will look through the string and see how many letters match, and replace them in the
other word.
finally, after each guess I will check if there are any *'s left, if there are not then the game is over.


Minesweeper:
I will generate a board made from a list of lists.
the first list will be of length x, while the rest will be of length y.
the cells of the list will be filled with the integers 0.
then I will randomly select a certain number of cells to be mines.
then i will increment the cells around each mine by 1.
finally, I will change all cells with "0" in them to be "_".
this will serve as my base board.
I will display a board with all "O" in it
then I will ask the user for a command (flag or select)
then I will check the base board, if the coordinate is a mine they lose, if not it
will display the number on the display board.
the player wins when there are no more unchecked tiles (this forces the use of all flags)
