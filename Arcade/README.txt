Mason Bentley
Terminal Arcade


This arcade has 3 main Functions
The first two are games and the third is a statistics portion about the games
The first option is hangman (which can be accesses by entering in 1)
The second option is minesweeper (which can be accesses by entering in 2)
and the third is statistics

Hangman:
to play hangman simply enter a letter as a guess (lower and upper are accepted)
once you have solved the puzzle you can say either "yes" or "no" to play again
the game also ends if you make 6 mistakes


Minesweeper:
when minesweeper is selected it will prompt you to enter 2 grid sizes and the amount of mines
the command should look something like this

5 5 3

this would be for a 5x5 board with 3 mines

to select a square (left click)
type "select x y" where x and y are the coordinates of the square
similarly if you want to plant a flag type "flag x y"
